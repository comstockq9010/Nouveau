    				<h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>
    				<p>Art Nouveau is an ornamental style of art that flourished between about 1890 and 1910 throughout Europe and the United States. Art Nouveau is characterized by its use of a long, sinuous, organic line and was employed most often in architecture, interior design, jewelry and glass design, posters, and illustration. It was a deliberate attempt to create a new style, free of the imitative historicism that dominated much of 19th-century art and design.
					<p>The distinguishing ornamental characteristic of Art Nouveau is its undulating asymmetrical line, often taking the form of flower stalks and buds, vine tendrils, insect wings, and other delicate and sinuous natural objects; the line may be elegant and graceful or infused with a powerfully rhythmic and whiplike force.
					</p>
					<p>
					After 1910 Art Nouveau appeared old-fashioned and limited and was generally abandoned as a distinct decorative style. In the 1960s, however, the style was rehabilitated, in part, by major exhibitions organized at the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1959) and at the Musée National d’Art Moderne (1960), as well as by a large-scale retrospective on Beardsley held at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London in 1966.

    								<h5>Czech Painter<br>1860 - 1939</br></h5>
    								<p>Alfons Maria Mucha, known internationally as Alphonse Mucha, was a Czech painter, illustrator and graphic artist, living in Paris during the Art Nouveau period, best known for his distinctly stylized and decorative theatrical posters, particularly those of Sarah Bernhardt.</p>
    								<p>Alphonse Mucha was and still remains best known for his Art Nouveau work, which frustrated him. According to his son and biographer, Jiří Mucha, he did not think much of Art Nouveau. "What is it, Art Nouveau?" he asked. "...Art can never be new." Alphonse Mucha took the greatest pride in his work as a history painter.</p>

    				<h4>Arcane Series</h4>
    				<p>Art Nouveau is used in the Netflix's series, Arcane, to show a left behind undercity, Zaun, in comparison to the city above, Piltover. Art nouveau as the predecessor to art deco naturally positions it as a bit darker and grittier and Arcane runs with this in shots of Zaun buildings.</p> 
    				<p>To reiterate, the splendor of art deco, including its celebration of industry, wouldn’t have been possible without art nouveau unifying fine and applied arts. Just as art deco grew from art nouveau and further defined the two outlooks and styles in relief, so does Zaun to Piltover.</p>

    				<a href="images/sixtiesLarge.jpg" class="pic" title="60's Comparison"><div class="sixties"><div class="hoverBox"></div></div></a>
    				<h4>Psychadelic 60's</h4>
    				<p>In the sixties, after the drab post-war years were finally over and the economic situation was a bit better, artists and designers demanded the liberty of colour and design. Taking inspiration from the past, in a hope for a better artistic future, designers combined the refinement and elegance of Victorian and Edwardian art; floral prints, aestheticism and playful lines, and combined it with acid-laced colours such as magenta, aqua and bright yellow. Inspiration was often found in flamboyant turn of the century designs by Klimt, Aubrey Beardsley, Mucha and Georges de Feure.</p>

    				<h4>Disney's Enchanted</h4>
    				<p>The animated sequence has a lot of art nouveau influences. The background designs took a lot of influence from many pieces of the era. Character designers had also used the period as a starting point for the main character, Giselle. Her look is very reminiscent of Alphonse Mucha's <span>Moët & Chandon White Star (1899).</span></p>
